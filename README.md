### How to remove the epoxy housing on a VLSI chip

The method is linked in the article on John Grips [page](https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/ ), Chips a la Antoine. Heat up the epoxy with a hot air station, crack it open with pliers. Works well on the epoxy MOS used, less well on some other brands.

### Other notes on reverse engineering VLSI chips

@Johan Grip How so you Go about Reverse engineering ics in General? Do you have the schematic of all the ics of the c128

Johan Grip â€” 09/09/2022
Depends on the IC. For the MMU I'm working from the datasheet and observed behaviours. For the PLA I used a microscope to take photos of the silicon and reverse engineered that way.

burnhard â€” 09/09/2022
Is there some Info ob how to do this Second Method? I would really Like to learn how to do this.

Johan Grip â€” 09/09/2022
I did a write up on my homepage, https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/ though it's not very detailed.
Second part of my talk at VCF East this year was also about silicon reversing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMMiyUGEygE

Is there some literature which you could recommend?

Johan Grip â€” 09/09/2022
Yes, actually. It does depend on which chips one wants to reverse, in my case I'm pretty much only focusing on MOS/CSG chips so NMOS.
For that I found https://www.amazon.de/dp/0201043580/ very useful.

Learning how to reverse ICs means also learning how they are made.

burnhard â€” 09/09/2022
Thank you will give it a try
What do you use to get rid of the epoxy housing?
Nitrit Avid?
Acid

burnhard â€” 09/09/2022
Thanks I will give it a try

Johan Grip â€” 09/09/2022
For microscope you'd need a metallurgical with reflected light. Which one is a whole topic by itself ðŸ™‚

burnhard â€” 09/09/2022
Do you have a recommendation for me ðŸ˜‰

Johan Grip â€” 09/09/2022
It gets tricky straight up. Depends on budget, availability of used ones, what chips one wants to look at, etc. etc.
My first I bought for this purpose was an AmScope ME580T-PZ-2L which works well optically. I did have problems motorizing the stage but others have had more success.
This image of a 6526A was taken with that amscope: https://siliconpr0n.org/map/mos/8521r0/mz/
Today I'm using an Olympus BH2 w/ UMA illuminator and a whole mess of home brew for driving the stage.

burnhard â€” 09/09/2022
Thanks for the tip

burnhard â€” 09/11/2022
@Johan Grip hello thanks for the much required help
Do you actually have some personal documentation on the homebrew side, because I saw a decent priced scope (Olympus  BH2 w/ UMA illuminator) on ebay.

Johan Grip â€” 09/11/2022
Not documentation as such, but I'm happy to answer questions and help out in any way I can. The core is a small board with an ESP32 running FluidNC, https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC

This then controls the stepper motors that move the stage around.

burnhard â€” 09/11/2022
Thank you I really appreciate it

Johan Grip â€” 09/11/2022
Current setup looks like this. Olympus BH2 w/ UMA, mounted on a Nikon base. X/Y linear stages, Z stage, tip/tilt stages all motorized and a manual rotation stage on top. Imaging is a Sony Alpha a6000 with some adaptor optics.

burnhard â€” 09/11/2022
wow this looks great
what kind of driverboard do you use for the stepper motors

Johan Grip â€” 09/11/2022
It's a custom board based on Bart Dring's sixpack board, I mostly just moved to stepper sticks and smaller connectors as I don't need high current. I just wanted a smaller board compared to the original.
