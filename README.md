## Learning Electronics
- [Notes on Electronics](electronics_notes.md)
  These notes serve as a quick way to learn electronics or a refresher for hobbiests, but do not replace a full course or textbook on electronics.  A proper textbook
  on electronics is recommended, such as **Introduction To Electronics by Earl Gates** and a proper course such as [Introduction to Electronics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/electronics) is also recommended.
